All the codes and their respective links have been submitted in the submission report itself, but to compile everything at one place, we madethis repo.

## Experiments

1. [Lab Assignment 1: Graph Search Agent for 8-Puzzle](/lab1/)
2. [Lab Assignment 3: TSP using Simulated Annealing](/lab3/)
3. [Lab Assignment 4: Game Playing Agent | Minimax| Alpha-Beta Pruning](/lab4/)
4. [Lab Assignment 5: Building Bayesian Networks in R](/lab5/)
5. [Lab Assignment 6: Hidden Markov Model and Expectation Maximization algorithm](/lab6/)
6. [Lab Assignment 7: Markov Random Field and Hopfield Network](/lab7/)

## Some General Notes

-   Preferably use [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab.io/) to open the notebooks locally.
-   To open it as an excutable in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), refer [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Rmai0dD30XzL).
